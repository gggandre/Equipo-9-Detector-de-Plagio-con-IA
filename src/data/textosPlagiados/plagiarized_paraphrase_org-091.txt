video game suffer be in the concentrate of the inquiry and academician community for the last few years, with the study and experiment of artificial general intelligence (AGI) stand out. AGI experiment platforms allow to analyze and study, inch angstrom ocular way, the behavior of different artificial intelligence agent previously defined. inch this solve a fresh game engine, call GAGI, capable of serve as Associate in Nursing AGI experiment platform is presented. vitamin A a game engine, GAGI is able to invention and create novel second and three-D video bet on use C++ program language. Moreover, GAGI provide the drug user with angstrom unique environment for simulating and study artificial insemination agent inside the created game. drug user toilet deploy multiple AI agent while interacting with them indium real time, improving the reason of their interaction and behaviors. The feature of the proposed software is compare against others widely-used game engines in the video games industry as well as in the research community, highlight the advantage Indiana condition of invention capability and AI support. GAGI besides offer the possibility to reproduce the experiments, opening improving multiple possibilities for the research community.
