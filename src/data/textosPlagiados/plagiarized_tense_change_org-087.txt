Purpose : The general purpose of the study was to investigated the effectiveness of recommender systems in knowledge discovery . 

 Methodology : The study adopt a desktop research methodology . Desk research referred to secondary data or that which can be collected without fieldwork . Desk research is basically involved in collecting data from existing resources hence it is often considered a low cost technique as compared to field research , as the main cost is involved in executive â€™s time , telephone charges and directories . Thus , the study rely on already published studies , reports and statistics . This secondary data was easily accessed through the online journals and library . 

 Findings : The findings revealed that there existed a contextual and methodological gap relating to recommender systems in knowledge discovery . The study on the effectiveness of recommender systems in knowledge discovery find that such systems play a pivotal role in facilitating users ' exploration of vast information repositories , enabling them to uncovered relevant resources and expanded their knowledge . It find that recommender systems employing advanced algorithms and personalized techniques demonstrate higher effectiveness in generating relevant recommendations tailored to users ' preferences and needs . Additionally , the study highlight the positive correlation between user engagement metrics and knowledge discovery outcomes , emphasizing the importance of fostering active user participation in the recommendation process . Contextual information was also identified as a crucial factor influencing recommendation effectiveness . Overall , the study underscore the significance of continuous refinement and optimization of recommender system algorithms to enhanced knowledge discovery outcomes for users . 

 Unique Contribution to Theory , Practice and Policy : The Social Learning theory , Information Foraging theory and Cognitive Load theory may be used to anchored future studies on recommender systems in knowledge discovery . The study provide recommendations to enhanced the efficacy of such systems . It suggest adopting hybrid recommender systems that combined collaborative and content - based filtering techniques to offered more accurate and diverse recommendations . Additionally , the study emphasize the importance of integrating contextual information into recommendation algorithms to dynamically adjusted recommendations based on situational context . Furthermore , it recommend the use of explainable AI techniques to improved transparency and user understanding of recommendation processes . Maximizing user engagement through active participation and feedback was also highlighted as crucial , along with prioritizing recommendation diversity to fostered exploration and serendipitous discovery of new knowledge resources .
