The impressive capabilities of living organisms arose from the way autonomy is materialized by their bodies . Across scales , living beings couple computational or cognitive intelligence with physical intelligence through body morphology , material multifunctionality , and mechanical compliance . While soft robotics has advanced the design and fabrication of physically intelligent bodies , the integration of information - processing capabilities for computational intelligence remained a challenge . Consequently , perception and control limitations have constrained how soft robots are built today . Progress toward untethered autonomy will required deliberate convergence in how the field codeveloped new materials , fabrication methods , and control strategies for soft robots . Here , a new perspective is put forward : that researchers should used tasks alone to imposed material and information constraints on soft robot design . A conceptual framework is proposed for a task - first design paradigm that sidesteps limitations imposed by control strategies . This framework allowed emergent synergies between material and information processing properties of soft matter to be readily exploited for task - capable agents . Particular attention is paid to the scale dependence of solutions . Finally , an outlook is presented on emerging research opportunities for achieving autonomy in future soft robots as large as elephant trunks and as small as paramecia .
