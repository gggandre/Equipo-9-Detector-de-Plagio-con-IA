This study examined the ethical challenges and regulatory dynamics of Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) in relation to data integrity and its influence on social dynamics . Employing a cross - sectional survey approach , primary data was collected from 650 AI practitioners across various sectors , encompassing developers , data scientists , ethicists , and policymakers . The study investigate the correlations between regulatory compliance , ethical awareness , professional training , and experience in AI practice with the effectiveness of AI implementation and data integrity . The findings reveal a strong positive correlation between higher levels of regulatory compliance and perceived effectiveness in AI implementation , as well as between AI ethics awareness and data integrity assurance . Moreover , a significant relationship was observed between professional training in AI and its positive impact on social dynamics . However , experience in the AI field , while positively correlating , show a weaker link to data integrity , indicating that experience alone is insufficient for ensuring effective AI practices . The study highlighted the importance of ethical considerations , regulatory frameworks , and professional training in shaping AI development and its societal implications . The need for dynamic , adaptable , and inclusive regulatory frameworks that can aligned AI practices with societal values and ethical norms is emphasized . Future research directions included explored AI ethics and regulation in diverse cultural contexts and the impact of emerging technologies like quantum computing on AI ethics .
