The growing population also led to a growing consumer base which increased the load and resources to catered the needs of the day - by - day increasing consumers . Just as technology is being used to solved all the problems so why not this one . The idea is to made a more convenient and advanced super market experience , where there was no cashiers or lines so that we can shopped hassle free . This project implemented Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things to automated a supermarket for better efficiency . A person just needed to walked in after scanning their QR code through the app with their unique ID on it . It will recorded the customer 's presence in the shop . The shopping carts and baskets had sensors on them , which can detected the product entering or being taken out . The products are placed on shelves which had pressure sensors to detected if any product is picked up . These shelves are closed and they only open with your shopping cards . When you reached the counter , you only have swipe your card again and money will be deducted from your account according to your purchase and a receipt will be given . We looked forward to provided this technology to various super market chains in the country and abroad and helped them implemented it with a nominal one time investment .
