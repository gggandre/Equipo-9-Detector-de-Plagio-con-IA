With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, there is Associate in Nursing increase number of industry relying on the accuracy and efficiency of deep learn algorithms. merely due to the inexplicability and black box effect of deep neural networks, we buttocks only prevail results without knowing the applied reason behind them. That engenders scepticism and resistance from some quarters of cryptic learning-based technologies. In the context of emotion analysis used in business and public opinion monitoring, information technology be sometimes difficult for decision-makers to trust the consequence without explanation from the supposedly emotionless machines. There are mathematical-based explanation methods, and they often generalise emotion analysis ampere a classification task. Still, emotion should be different from other task categories because the generation of emotion involves human-specific component and logic. This composition propose an emotion analysis explanation framework that is grounded in psychological theories concenter on the stimulus from classic emotion theories. This propose framework underscore considering the cause and trigger of emotions as the explanation for the deep learning-based emotion analysis, and it includes two main components: the extraction of the emotion cause and the visualisation of emotion-triggering words.
