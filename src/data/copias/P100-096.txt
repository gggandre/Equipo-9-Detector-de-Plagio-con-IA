In scientific disciplines such as biomechanics, genetics, ethology, and neurology, accurate tracking of animal behavior is crucial for studies, often without the use of markers. However, precise stance extraction from constantly shifting backgrounds has posed challenges. Recently, an open-source toolbox utilizing advanced algorithms for human position estimation was unveiled, enabling users to train deep neural networks for accurate monitoring of user-defined features. This revised Python module incorporates new features, including graphical user interfaces (GUIs), performance enhancements, and network refinement through active learning, empowering users to create unique and repeatable analysis pipelines using graphical processing units (GPUs).
