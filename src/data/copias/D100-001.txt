This study aims to disclose how artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to the education sector and explore potential research trends and challenges. The content analysis showed that the research questions could be classified into development layers and application layers. Moreover, four research trends were suggested for further investigation. However, we also proposed challenges in education caused by AI, including inappropriate use of AI techniques and changing roles of teachers and students. The results provide insights into an overview of AI used in the education domain, strengthening the theoretical foundation of AI in education and providing a promising channel for collaborative research between educators and AI engineers.
