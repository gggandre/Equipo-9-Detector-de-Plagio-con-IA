In this paper, the concept of self-reproduction characteristic of artificial life is introduced to computer animation. A self-reproduction model of artificial fish, based on gene control, is proposed and constructed. The model defines the contents of an artificial fish's chromosome based on its phenotype, along with heredity rules. This enables artificial fish to reproduce and grow within a virtual marine environment, governed by gene models and rules. Artificial behaviors encompass both predefined and nondeterminate behaviors. Additionally, cognitive models based on artificial intelligence are developed to control the high-level behaviors of artificial fish. A simulation program is designed and developed to integrate these models, laying the groundwork for enhancing the efficiency and automation of artificial fish animation.
