An experiment is documented here involving the utilization of an Artificial Life competitive game, which simulates an environment of artificial life for unstructured and informal teaching of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to students pursuing computer science engineering careers. The game is set in a simulated Petri dish where two colonies of microorganisms, acting as software agents, must strive for survival. To achieve this objective, participants are required to implement strategies for survival for their agents, encompassing fighting strategies and basic reproduction rules to dominate the artificial environment. The contest's technical foundations, along with a detailed description of the artificial life model, are expounded upon. The pedagogical experience gained from the contest's development is examined, as well as the resultant learning experience, which sparked enthusiasm among students and facilitated the development of mental models of potential AI algorithms.
