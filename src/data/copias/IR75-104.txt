Machine learning (ML) is a form of artificial intelligence poised to transform the twenty-first century. Recent rapid progress in its underlying architecture and algorithms, along with the expansion in the size of datasets, has led to increased computational competence across various fields. These include driving vehicles, language translation, chatbots, and surpassing human performance at complex board games such as Go. Here, we review the fundamentals and algorithms behind machine learning and highlight specific approaches to learning and optimization. We then summarize the applications of ML to medicine, showcasing recent diagnostic performances, and caveats, in fields such as dermatology, radiology, pathology, and general microscopy.
