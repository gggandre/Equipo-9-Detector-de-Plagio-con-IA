During the COVID-19 pandemic, Delhi, India grappled with a pressing concern as nearly 1,500 COVID-19-positive patients went missing. In times of public health emergencies, such as pandemics or natural disasters, hospitals and medical centers witness a sudden influx of patients, leading to managerial challenges in patient tracking, particularly amidst patient transfers or the establishment of temporary healthcare facilities. These challenges often precipitate a surge in missing person cases, with patients inadvertently separated from their families. The human face serves as a unique biometric system capable of discerning an individual's age, gender, mood, and even identity for verification purposes. Harnessing the potency of deep learning and artificial intelligence, one of the foremost applications of computer vision is Patient Identification. In this study, we propose a cutting-edge patient face detection model employing a twofold approach: the utilization of MTCNN (multi-task cascaded convolution neural network) for face detection and alignment alongside the renowned FaceNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for face embedding, culminating in a KNN algorithm classifier boasting a remarkable accuracy of 97.1%. Additionally, to fortify public safety during the pandemic, we've devised a Resnet34 model for mask detection trained on the Face Mask Detection dataset, achieving an accuracy of 97%. This study not only tackles the immediate challenges of patient identification and safety during crises but also holds implications for broader healthcare applications, offering promising avenues for enhancing patient care and security.
