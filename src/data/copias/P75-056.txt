Recent years have witnessed a convergence between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and neuroscience, particularly in understanding neural processes and developing treatments for neurological disorders. Artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques offer valuable insights into neural processing and brain function, providing new avenues for exploring individual happiness. This study employs a bibliometric analysis of articles from the Scopus database spanning 2013-2023 to evaluate the interaction between neuroscience and happiness through AI advancements. The analysis reveals significant scientific production primarily centered in the United States, United Kingdom, and China. Three distinct clusters emerge from the analysis, highlighting AI applications in predicting happiness, tools for neuroscience research, and the intersection of neuroscience with psychology. Overall, neuroscience research, coupled with AI advancements, contributes to a deeper understanding of mental processes, emotions, and consciousness, particularly in exploring the concept of happiness.
