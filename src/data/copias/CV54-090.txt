Given the challenges of inter-domain information fusion and data sparsity in collaborative filtering algorithms, this paper proposes a cross-domain information fusion matrix decomposition algorithm to enhance the accuracy of personalized recommendations in artificial intelligence recommendation systems. The study begins by collecting Douban movie rating data and social network information. Levenshtein distance detection is used to ensure data integrity by removing duplicate scores, while natural language processing is employed to extract keywords and topic information from social texts. Additionally, graph convolutional networks convert user relationships into feature vectors, and a thermal coding method is used to convert discrete user and movie information into binary matrices. To prevent overfitting, the Ridge regularization method is introduced to optimize potential feature vectors gradually. Weighted average and feature connection techniques integrate features from different fields. Moreover, the paper combines item-based collaborative filtering with merged user characteristics to generate personalized recommendation lists. In experiments, cross-domain information fusion optimization is conducted on four mainstream mathematical matrix decomposition algorithms: alternating least squares method, non-negative matrix decomposition, singular value decomposition, and latent factor model (LFM), comparing them with the non-fused approach. Results show significant improvement in score accuracy, with mean absolute error and root mean squared error reduced by 12.8% and 13.2%, respectively, across the four algorithms. Additionally, when k = 10, the average F1 score reaches 0.97, and the ranking accuracy coverage of the LFM algorithm increases by 54.2%. Overall, the mathematical matrix decomposition algorithm combined with cross-domain information fusion demonstrates clear advantages in accuracy, prediction performance, recommendation diversity, and ranking quality, significantly surpassing traditional models in recommendation accuracy and variety.
