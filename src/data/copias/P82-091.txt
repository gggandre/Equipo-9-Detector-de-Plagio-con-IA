Over the past several years, there has been significant attention from researchers and academics towards video games, particularly in the exploration of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). AGI experimentation platforms have emerged as crucial tools, facilitating the analysis and observation of various AI agents' behaviors in a visual manner. This paper introduces a new gaming engine named GAGI, which serves as an AGI experimentation platform. Functioning as a game engine, GAGI enables the creation of innovative 2D and 3D video games using the C++ programming language. Additionally, GAGI offers a distinct environment for simulating and observing AI agents within the games created. Users have the capability to deploy multiple AI agents and interact with them in real-time, thereby enhancing the comprehension of their interactions and behaviors. A comparative analysis of the features of GAGI against other well-established gaming engines in both the video games industry and the research community demonstrates its advantages, particularly in terms of design flexibility and AI support. Moreover, GAGI facilitates the replication of experiments, opening up numerous opportunities for the research community.
