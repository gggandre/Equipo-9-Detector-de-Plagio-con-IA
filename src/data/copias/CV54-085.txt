Internet of Things (IoT)-based remote healthcare applications offer quick and preventative medical services to patients at risk. However, predicting heart disease is complex, and diagnosis results are often inaccurate. To address this issue, a novel Recommendation System for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using IoT Network (DEEP-CARDIO) has been proposed. This system provides prior diagnosis, treatment, and dietary recommendations for cardiac diseases. Initially, physiological data are collected remotely from patients using four biosensors: ECG, Pressure, Pulse, and Glucose sensors. An Arduino controller receives this data from the IoT sensors to predict and diagnose diseases. A cardiovascular disease prediction model is implemented using a BiGRU (Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit) attention model, which diagnoses cardiovascular diseases and classifies them into five categories. The recommendation system offers physical and dietary recommendations to cardiac patients based on classified data via a user mobile application. The DEEP-CARDIO performance is validated using CloudSim with real-time Framingham's and Statlog heart disease dataset, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.90%, surpassing existing methods.
