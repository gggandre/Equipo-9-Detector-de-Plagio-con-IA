This article explores adaptive fuzzy event-triggered formation tracking control for nonholonomic multirobot systems characterized by infinite actuator faults and range constraints. To address these challenges, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are employed, and adaptive methods are used to approximate unknown nonlinear functions and uncertain parameters inherent in robotic dynamics. Throughout information exploration, collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance issues persist due to distance and visual field limitations. In response, a general barrier function and prescribed performance methodology are introduced to effectively address constrained range obstacles. Furthermore, to reduce controller executions and compensate for any effects stemming from infinite actuator failures, robots engage with their leader at the moment of actuator faults using fewer network communication resources while maintaining uninterrupted tracking of the desired trajectory generated by the leader. Leveraging dynamic surface technology, a decentralized adaptive event-triggering fault-tolerant (ETFT) formation control strategy is proposed. The strategy ensures that all signals are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Ultimately, the practical feasibility of the ETFT control strategy for nonholonomic multirobot systems is demonstrated.
