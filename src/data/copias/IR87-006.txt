As emphasized by Stephen Yang in his ICCE 2019 keynote speech (Yang, 2019), precision education presents a new challenge when applying artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and learning analytics to enhance teaching quality and learning performance. The aim of precision education is to identify at-risk students as early as possible and provide timely interventions based on teaching and learning experiences (Lu et al., 2018). Building on the central theme of precision education, this special issue advocates for an in-depth dialogue between technology and humanity, offering deeper insights into precision education. For this special issue, thirteen research papers focusing on precision education, AI, machine learning, and learning analytics were exchanged, providing in-depth research experiences concerning various applications, methods, pedagogical models, and environments, fostering a better understanding of AI's application in education.
