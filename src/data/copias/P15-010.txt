The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping various sectors, including education, by improving the learning process, enhancing student outcomes, and streamlining administrative tasks. This study seeks to investigate the application of AI in educational management, analyzing both its benefits and challenges. Employing a systematic review approach, the research examines existing literature on AI in educational management. It is evident from the study that AI offers several advantages, such as enhancing student engagement, personalizing learning experiences, and reducing costs. However, the deployment of AI also presents challenges, including ethical considerations, potential biases, and the need for workforce re-skilling. In conclusion, while AI holds tremendous potential to enhance educational management, its implementation must be approached with careful consideration and attention.
