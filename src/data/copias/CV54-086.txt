The recent trend in delivering computing resources as a service represents a shift towards computing as a service delivered over the internet from large-scale data centers. With the advent of cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence (AI), which are revolutionizing customer experience automation in areas such as recommender systems (RS), various modifications are required to support IoT devices, including recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard, and technologies like nanotechnology. This paper introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC). Despite numerous studies on FC "smart" applications, none have focused on fog-based smart marketing domains like recommender systems. FC is a novel computational system that mitigates latency and improves bandwidth utilization for autonomous consumer behavior applications requiring real-time data-driven decision-making. This paper provides a conceptual framework for studying the effects of fog computing on consumer behavior, focusing on the intersection of FC and RS as an example. The conceptualization of "fog-based recommender systems" opens novel avenues for academic research, highlighting various challenges and research issues.
