Artificial intelligence has metamorphosed into an indispensable component of both production and service systems in contemporary times, seamlessly integrating into daily life. Autonomous driving vehicles, colloquially known as driverless cars, operate sans human drivers. Research on autonomous vehicles has witnessed unprecedented advancements, with artificially intelligent autonomous vehicles representing a societal imperative. Despite apprehensions surrounding relinquishing vehicle control to computers, automated driving technologies harbor the potential to enhance road safety and address environmental concerns. Unlike humans, computers do not struggle with maintaining attention during driving, and their prompt responses can avert accidents and mitigate potential road hazards. Self-driving technology offers myriad advantages, including facilitating accessible transportation for individuals unable to drive due to various factors. This chapter delves into the software and hardware architectures of autonomous cars, elucidating their components, benefits, and future prospects.
