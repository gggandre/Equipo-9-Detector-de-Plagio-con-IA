The performance of photovoltaic (PV) systems is directly impacted by climatic changes. The controller maintains maximum potential energy conversion to operate the pumping system under nominal conditions. Fuzzy logic intelligent controllers are effectively suited and applicable in engineering and applied science. The objective of this paper is to present an experimental approach to implementing fuzzy logic maximum power point tracking (MPPT) with a boost converter based on the Arduino Mega micro-controller to maximize energy production under different weather conditions applied to small-scale pumping systems for water and chemical fluid analyses in isolated areas. The system is powered by a 20 W solar photovoltaic (PV) panel. This paper presents a real-time MATLAB/Simulink fuzzy logic method for controlling and monitoring MPPT applications using a low-cost Arduino Mega micro-controller combined with (LV25, LP55) sensors controlling a boost converter interconnected with a solar panel and plastic pump.
