This study investigates the ethical challenges and regulatory dynamics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) concerning data integrity and its impact on social dynamics. Through a cross-sectional survey involving 650 AI practitioners across various sectors, including developers, data scientists, ethicists, and policymakers, primary data is collected. The study explores correlations between regulatory compliance, ethical awareness, professional training, and experience in AI practice with AI implementation effectiveness and data integrity. Findings reveal a strong positive correlation between higher regulatory compliance levels and perceived AI implementation effectiveness, as well as between AI ethics awareness and data integrity assurance. Additionally, a significant relationship is observed between professional AI training and its positive impact on social dynamics. However, experience in the AI field, while positively correlated, exhibits a weaker link to data integrity, indicating that experience alone is insufficient for ensuring effective AI practices. This study highlights the pivotal role of ethical considerations, regulatory frameworks, and professional training in shaping AI development and its societal implications. It underscores the necessity for dynamic, adaptable, and inclusive regulatory frameworks aligning AI practices with societal values and ethical norms. Future research directions may include exploring AI ethics and regulation in diverse cultural contexts and the influence of emerging technologies like quantum computing on AI ethics
