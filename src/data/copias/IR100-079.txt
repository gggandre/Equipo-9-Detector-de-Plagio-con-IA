This paper substantiates the methodological approach to assessing personnel risks of enterprises by applying the fuzzy logic apparatus to identify personnel risk management issues and provide appropriate recommendations for their resolution. The methodological basis of the study relies on classic provisions and fundamental works of foreign and domestic scientists, statistical data, and the results of research into the problems of assessing personnel risks of enterprises. Fuzzy set theory, comparative analysis, scientific abstraction, generalization of modern theoretical research, and a system-complex approach were employed as methods. The study proposes a methodological approach to assessing the level of personnel risks of an enterprise, and numerical experiments were conducted on a group of construction equipment manufacturers. Analysis of the results of assessing the level of personnel risks of enterprises allowed the identification of problems in managing personnel risks at enterprises. The mathematical problem statement considers hierarchical fuzzy data, with four groups of indicators for assessing the level of personnel risks. These indicators are functions of fuzzy coefficients, and the output variable is an integrated indicator of the personnel risk level, also a fuzzy value. Expert evaluations of input data variation are categorized as Low (I), Medium (G), or High (E). The constructed system of fuzzy logical inference, based on fuzzy set theory, allows for the estimation of the level of personnel risk at the enterprise, facilitating the substantiation of measures to increase its efficiency and providing more efficient decision-making under uncertain conditions.
