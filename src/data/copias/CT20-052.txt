Artificial intelligence chatbots have penetrated the tourism industry, owing to their cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency. However, researchers have largely overlooked the influence of emotional expressions of chatbots on service outcomes. Drawing upon expectancy violations theory, this study explores how emotional expressions of chatbots affect customer satisfaction using three experiments centered on tourist attraction recommendations. Chatbots' expressions of concern for customers can enhance customer satisfaction by mitigating expectancy violations. Specifically, customer goal orientation, the human-likeness of chatbot avatars, and the relationship type between customers and chatbots can moderate the negative relationship between emotional expression and expectancy violation. These findings propel research on the emotional expressions of chatbots and offer critical insights for deploying chatbots in customer service within the tourism industry.
