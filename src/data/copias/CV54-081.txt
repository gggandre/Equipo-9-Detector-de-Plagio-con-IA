The rise of easy internet access and technological advancements has led to information overload and an abundance of options, making decision-making extremely challenging. Recommender Systems (RS) emerge as a potential solution for aiding users in decision-making by suggesting or predicting product ratings. Three fundamental forms of RS, which utilize implicit or explicit feedback for recommendation, are collaborative, content-based, and hybrid filtering. While ratings are the most common form of feedback, other variables such as product descriptions, reviews, images, audios, and videos are also crucial and can enhance the performance of traditional RS. These additional variables can significantly impact RS performance. Traditional RSs relied on approaches like nearest neighbor or other machine learning models, but recent advancements in artificial intelligence and deep learning have led to the development of RSs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which efficiently utilize auxiliary information. This article not only compares CNN-based RSs on common grounds but also provides a comprehensive overview of how CNN-based RSs can utilize various types of auxiliary information. The study also delves into data characteristics, data statistics, and auxiliary information across a range of publicly available datasets. It also discusses different evaluation measures for RSs and presents readers with intriguing challenges and open research issues.
