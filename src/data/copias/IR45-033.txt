How do individuals distribute risks associated with autonomous vehicles (AVs) in everyday road traffic scenarios? Extensive literature on AV ethics typically centers on moral judgments in unavoidable collision scenarios. We advocate extending this discourse to encompass driving behaviors in routine road traffic, where ubiquitous ethical dilemmas surface due to the perpetual redistribution of risks among road users. This risk redistribution underscores ethically pertinent inquiries that elude simplistic heuristics such as "hitting the brakes." Utilizing an interactive, graphical representation of diverse traffic situations, we gauge participants' preferences regarding AV driving maneuvers via a representative survey conducted in Germany. Intriguingly, participants' preferences extend beyond mere collision avoidance, evidencing a willingness to assume risks for the benefit of fellow road users. This suggests that the social dilemma associated with AVs may be assuaged within precarious environments. Our findings advocate for a constructive discourse between engineers and philosophers to navigate the ethical landscape of AVs more adeptly.
