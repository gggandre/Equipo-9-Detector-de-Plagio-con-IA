This article examines the factors contributing to technological disruptions in electrical systems and identifies inherent drawbacks in the protection and automation of electrical system components. It argues that the transition from analog to digital protection mechanisms has led to decreased reliability in relay protection systems. To mitigate these challenges, the article proposes the integration of fuzzy logic elements into protection devices and automation systems, emphasizing the benefits of utilizing fuzzy logic to identify various types of short circuits. Through modeling exercises and simulations, the article demonstrates the effectiveness of fuzzy logic in identifying and addressing asymmetric short circuits within electrical systems. Additionally, the article presents an algorithm for protection and automation operations leveraging fuzzy logic elements, aimed at reducing the time required to identify damage types and trigger protective measures.
