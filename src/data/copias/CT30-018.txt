The application of AI and machine learning, particularly the vision transformer method, in bacterial detection offers a promising solution to address the limitations of traditional methods. This research introduces a novel positional self-attention transformer model for the classification of bacterial colonies, presenting a groundbreaking approach to overcoming existing challenges. Leveraging the success of transformer architectures across various domains, we have enhanced the model's performance by integrating a positional self-attention mechanism. Our proposed approach allows for the effective capture of spatial relationships and patterns within bacterial colonies, leading to highly accurate classification results. Trained on a substantial dataset of bacterial images, our model demonstrates robustness and generalization to diverse colony types. With an accuracy rate of 98.50% in colony classification, our model surpasses traditional methods, offering unprecedented accuracy in discerning subtle morphological variations. The adaptability of our model to diverse colony shapes and arrangements marks a significant advancement, promising to redefine bacterial colony analysis through the lens of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.
