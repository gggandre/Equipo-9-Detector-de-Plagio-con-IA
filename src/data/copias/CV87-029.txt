Face recognition plays a crucial role in security applications, particularly in household CC cameras aimed at recognizing individuals. This paper presents a system utilizing machine learning (ML) and AI algorithms to recognize intruders through surveillance cameras. By implementing HOG feature extraction and SVM classification algorithms, the system successfully classifies faces from video streams. The primary objective is to recognize individuals using HOG feature extraction and SVM, distinguishing between authorized personnel and intruders within an organization.
