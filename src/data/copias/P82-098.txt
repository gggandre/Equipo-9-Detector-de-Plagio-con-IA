Serious video games offer immersive learning experiences for agricultural education by simulating real-life scenarios and challenges. Despite limited empirical evidence of their effectiveness, this scoping review summarizes literature on serious video games for agricultural learning, identifying research trends and gaps. Through systematic searches across nine prominent research databases, 19 articles published between January 2000 and July 2022 were included in the review. Most reviewed games were developed in the past five years, predominantly targeting the mobile platform and employing a simulation-based approach with 2-D graphics. These games primarily focus on crop production and sustainable agriculture, often targeting students. Evaluation protocols typically entail pilot studies emphasizing user experience and knowledge enhancement. Positive outcomes such as improved user experiences, knowledge, and attitude changes were commonly observed. The review underscores advancements in using serious video games for agricultural learning while highlighting the need for deeper exploration of their impact on user experience and effectiveness.
