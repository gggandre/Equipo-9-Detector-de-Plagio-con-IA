This article investigates a solution to the primary challenges of induction machine control to achieve superior dynamic performance. Conventional direct torque control and indirect control with flux orientation possess drawbacks such as current harmonics, torque ripples, flux ripples, and rise time. In this article, we present a comparative analysis between previous approaches and one using fuzzy logic. Simulation results demonstrate that the direct torque control method using fuzzy logic is more effective in providing precise and fast responses without overshooting, eliminating torque and flux fluctuations at low switching frequencies. The demonstrated improvements in dynamic performance contribute to increased operational efficiency and reliability in industrial applications.
