Objects in real-world scenarios are characterized by various types of random perturbations, significantly compromising control process quality. As a result, the use of modern intellectual technology methods to solve the problem of synthesizing control systems for structurally complex dynamic objects has become necessary. This article addresses the synthesis of automatic control systems for dynamic objects by employing intelligent control theory. A neural network based on radial-basis functions is employed at each discrete interval for neuro-fuzzy approximation of the control system, allowing real-time adjustment of regulator parameters. The radial basis function is designed to approximate functions defined in implicit pattern sets. Configuration of the neuro-fuzzy regulator's parameters is achieved using a genetic algorithm, enabling more efficient computation to determine the regulator's set parameters. The regulator's parameters are represented as a vector, facilitating their application to multidimensional objects. To determine the optimal tuning parameters of the neuro-fuzzy regulator, characterized by high convergence and the ability to determine global extrema, a genetic algorithm is employed. The effectiveness of the neuro-fuzzy regulator lies in its ability to provide quality control of dynamic objects under random perturbations and uncertainty in input data.
