Well-being stands as a cornerstone of positive psychology, recognized for its positive impact not only on individuals' personal and professional lives but also on teams and organizations. Fostering comprehension and promotion of individual well-being proves pivotal for staff health and long-term prosperity, yet extant tools for subjective well-being assessment primarily rely on time-consuming surveys and questionnaires, hampering the provision of real-time feedback crucial for raising awareness and fostering individual behavior change. This paper proposes a framework for comprehending the process of non-verbal communication in teamwork, leveraging video data to identify significant predictors of individual well-being within team dynamics. Drawing upon video acquisition technologies and cutting-edge artificial intelligence tools, this framework extracts individual, relational, and environmental characteristics from panoramic video data. Statistical analysis is subsequently applied to generate a dataset comprising 125 features, linked to PERMA (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishments) surveys developed within the positive psychology context. Each aspect of the PERMA model is assessed as a regression or classification problem leveraging machine learning algorithms. We applied this approach in a case study wherein 80 students collaborated in 20 teams over a week on a team task in a face-to-face setting, leading to the formulation of several hypotheses identifying factors influencing individual well-being within team dynamics. These promising findings offer intriguing research avenues, including the fusion of different media for analyzing individual well-being within team settings.
