With advancements in education and technology, educators have come to realize that games should not merely serve as a means for student entertainment. Integrating games into teaching resources can yield superior teaching outcomes. However, the internet continually introduces new resources related to this endeavor. To provide higher-quality recommendations, this study proposes a personalized recommendation model for educational video game resources based on knowledge graphs. Initially, feature extraction is performed alternately on the user and item sides. Subsequently, a hidden Markov model is introduced based on the dual-end neighbor algorithm, optimized to consider the temporal nature of users. Experimental analysis reveals that the designed model achieves a hit rate index value of 0.7989 and a normalized cumulative gain value of 0.6045. Over 89% of users express satisfaction with the recommendations provided by this model. The constructed model efficiently delivers high-quality recommendations of educational video game resources, offering users a more convenient and efficient online experience.
