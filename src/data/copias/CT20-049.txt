Empathy represents a distinctive moral aspect of human behavior. The global workplace, along with its considerations of employee stakeholders, presents a unique blend of behavioral and ethical dimensions, prominently featuring human empathy. Within business organizations, human emotions and interactions fall under the purview of human resources and managerial oversight. As such, they are intricately interwoven with daily work-related expectations, employee-employer interactions, work practices, and the outcomes of employeesâ€™ work routines. Endemic aspects within workplaces include business ethics, human resources, and risk management practices. The increasing comprehension of models reliant on AI in business practices underscores the critical necessity of considering the ethical aspects of AI impacts on employees in the workplace. This paper meticulously explores a systematic ethical lens, delving into the opportunities and risks inherent in AI ideation, development, and deployment in business-employee relations practices, transcending a mere compliance mindset to introduce a broader spectrum of workplace considerations. Empathy, fundamentally concerned with human intentions, serves as a central theme. As such, this paper attributes ethical indications of the role of AI in the workplace and its impacts on employees. Moreover, it adopts a cognitive lens of empathy, focusing on artificial morality in relation to the ethical concerns, implications, and practices surrounding AI development, deployment, and workplace dynamics that may impact employees across various business dimensions.
