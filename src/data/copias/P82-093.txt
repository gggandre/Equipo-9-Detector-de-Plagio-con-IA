The effectiveness of exergames in enhancing student performance in Physical Education (PE) courses remains a topic of debate. This review investigates the positive impact of exergames on student learning in PE and the conditions under which this impact can be optimized. Employing the PICOS method, researchers conducted independent searches across various databases, including ProQuest, EBSCO, Web of Science (WoS), PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and VIP. The Cochrane system evaluation manual was utilized to assess literature quality, followed by meta-analysis of selected studies. Sixteen randomized controlled trials involving 2962 participants were included in the review. Meta-analysis results revealed a significant improvement in student PE learning performance through exergames (SMD = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.27–0.63, P < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis suggested that optimal results were observed when exergames were introduced in small kindergarten classes and sustained for 1–2 months.
