The advent of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) technologies has significantly altered modern lifestyles. AI encompasses various components, including advanced algorithms, ML, and DL, with promising prospects for providing automated solutions to ophthalmologists for early diagnosis and timely treatment of ocular disorders. AI, ML, and DL have been utilized in ophthalmic settings for disease diagnosis validation, image interpretation, corneal mapping, and intraocular lens calculations. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma are the primary causes of irreversible blindness globally. Ophthalmic imaging facilitates the diagnosis and objective monitoring of various pathologies, including DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ocular disorders. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become a widely used imaging modality in developed countries, owing to its high-resolution imaging capabilities. However, the increasing demand for imaging due to demographic changes and the limitations of trained human graders necessitate automated image analysis systems. Therefore, the future entails the inevitable development of unmanned automated applications for the detection and treatment of ocular disorders, leveraging current AI, ML, and DL methods.
