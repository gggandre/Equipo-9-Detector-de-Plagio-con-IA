As of the year 2021, over 30 countries have introduced national artificial intelligence (AI) policy strategies, outlining their plans and expectations regarding the impact of AI across various policy sectors, including education. This analysis delves into the thematic content of 24 such national AI policy strategies, with a specific focus on the role of education within the broader discourse on global AI policy. The findings indicate a notable absence of discussions surrounding the use of AI in education (AIED), despite a strong emphasis on the instrumental value of education in fostering an AI-ready workforce and training AI experts. Furthermore, ethical considerations pertaining to AIED receive limited attention, despite the prevalence of AI ethics discussions within these policy documents. This suggests a lack of mainstream awareness and prioritization of AIED's implications among key decision-makers. In light of these findings, the article proposes leveraging a framework of AI ethics principles to better integrate AIED considerations into policymaking discussions and offers recommendations for AIED scholars to engage more effectively with the policymaking process.
