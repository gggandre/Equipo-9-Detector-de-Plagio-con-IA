This article utilizes a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to examine voltage stability in a PV-based DC microgrid. The microgrid consists of several photovoltaic (PV) modules, a DC-DC converter, and loads. Due to the widespread use of intermittent PV power, voltage stability poses a critical challenge for DC microgrids and is challenging to achieve. This study proposes an FLC-based voltage control technique that leverages input factors such as PV output power, DC-DC converter duty cycle, and load current to determine the best course of action for maintaining the system's voltage stability. The FLC's performance is evaluated through simulation, and it is designed to be resilient to parameter fluctuations and uncertainties. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FLC-based control strategy effectively maintains the microgrid's voltage stability under various operational conditions, including changing solar irradiance and load variations. Furthermore, the FLC outperforms other control methods.
