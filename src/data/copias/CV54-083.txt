This paper presents a thorough literature review of the research and application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in recommender systems (RS). The objective is to identify recent trends, explore real-life applications, and guide researchers in positioning their research activities in this domain, with a focus on publications from 2023 (Jan-June). The findings are categorized into different domains, including education, healthcare, ML algorithms (auto-encoders and reinforcement learning), e-commerce, and digital journalism. The review highlights the enhanced recommendation accuracy, increased scalability, personalization and context awareness, diverse ML techniques, and strategies for handling cold start and data sparsity. It also lays the groundwork for future advancements in ML algorithms for RSs considering their application in manufacturing enterprises.
