Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) stands as an empirical search algorithm widely used in agent decision-making, particularly when combined with Deep Learning (DL), to master board games once deemed unconquerable. However, its success in real-time video games, which have stringent simulation time limits for exploration due to their design for human players, is less evident. This paper introduces a surrogate-assisted MCTS approach tailored for commercial real-time video games by approximating gameplay outcomes with a deep-learning-based surrogate model. The main contribution lies in designing a modified MCTS specifically for commercial real-time video games, which are significantly more complex and dynamic than non-commercial counterparts. We validated our approach through comparative experiments with other algorithms, including traditional MCTS, within the context of a commercial real-time video game environment.
