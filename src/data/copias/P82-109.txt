Drug design and development represent critical areas of research in pharmaceuticals, yet they face challenges such as low efficacy, off-target delivery, and high costs. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies offer solutions to these challenges by enabling rational drug design processes. ML algorithms have been integrated into various stages of drug discovery, including peptide synthesis, virtual screening, toxicity prediction, and pharmacophore modeling, facilitating the development of more effective drugs.
