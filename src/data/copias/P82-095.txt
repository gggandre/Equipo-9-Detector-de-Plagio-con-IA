Scholarship in international relations has long underscored the potential impact of popular culture on public perceptions and political dynamics. This article delves into these potentials within the context of military-themed video games, particularly their portrayals of weaponized artificial intelligence (AI). Within the paradoxical representations of AI weapons in video games as both "insurmountable enemies" posing existential threats and "easy targets" routinely overcome by human protagonists, distortions in human-machine interaction contradict real-world scenarios. These distortions revolve around video games granting players heightened human agency to dominate AI weapons for enjoyable gameplay, contrary to these weapons intended to diminish human agency on real battlefields. Leveraging the concept of "translation" from Actor-Network Theory, the article elucidates how these distorted portrayals of AI weapons arise from entanglements between diverse human and non-human actors aiming for mass-marketability and profitability in video games.
