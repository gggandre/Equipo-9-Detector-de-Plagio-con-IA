Maintaining an optimal difficulty level in video games is crucial for sustaining player engagement. Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) serves as a common method for optimizing player experience by dynamically modifying game elements. This paper conducts a literature review on DDA mechanisms, focusing on their utilization of machine learning techniques, player modeling approaches, assessment of player states, game genre, and application domains. Data from journal and conference articles published up to September 2022 were analyzed. Findings indicate significant positive effects of DDA on parameters such as enjoyment, flow, motivation, engagement, and immersion. Furthermore, there is a growing interest in machine learning and player modeling techniques in DDA design. However, given the expanding use of games across various domains, more research is needed to better understand player preferences for efficient game parameter adjustment.
