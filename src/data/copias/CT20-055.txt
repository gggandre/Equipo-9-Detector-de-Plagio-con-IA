Since the 1950s, numerous clinical cases have demonstrated the efficacy of art in rehabilitation therapy and psychological interventions. With the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, AI painting software based on the Stable Diffusion algorithm model enables image creation through prompts and feedback. Consequently, the question of whether AI painting software can positively influence human emotions becomes pivotal for its application in art therapy. This study tracks and measures emotional changes in patients before and after using AI painting software Stable Diffusion WebUI using emotional vocabulary measurement methods. Experimental data from this project suggests that artificial intelligence painting can have a positive impact on human emotions. This outcome paves the way for integrating artificial intelligence into art therapy research. On one hand, it facilitates the development of guided artificial intelligence painting software tailored for art therapyâ€”a specialized form of AI software for artistic healing. On the other hand, it encourages further exploration into the effectiveness of traditional painting versus AI-assisted painting in art therapy, aiming to uncover the underlying principles and mechanisms of art therapy.
