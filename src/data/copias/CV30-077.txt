Fuzzy inference systems (FISs) have been developed over many years, yet addressing high-dimensional problems remains a challenge. The product T-norm, commonly used for computing firing strengths, often suffers from numeric underflow issues, especially in high-dimensional scenarios. This paper focuses on mitigating this problem in high-dimensional FISs (HDFISs). For the product T-norm, we propose HDFIS-prod, which circumvents numeric underflow problems by incorporating an adaptive dimension-dependent membership function (DMF). Additionally, we address challenges with the minimum T-norm, resulting in another HDFIS named HDFIS-min. Both HDFIS-prod and HDFIS-min are evaluated on datasets with varying feature dimensions, demonstrating competitive performance on high-dimensional datasets.
