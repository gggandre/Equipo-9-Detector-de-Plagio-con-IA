Over recent decades, the proliferation of vehicles on roads has steadily increased, driven by the growing demand for urban mobility and modern logistics. However, this surge in vehicle numbers has led to detrimental effects such as increased traffic congestion and traffic accidents, hindering economic development. Addressing these challenges requires making vehicles smarter and less reliant on human intervention. Extensive research conducted globally over the past century has fueled the automation of road vehicles, with significant contributions from major motor manufacturers worldwide. The development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies is currently underway, propelled by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and big data. Understanding AI's development history is crucial to comprehend its role in AV systems, enabling vehicles to perceive their surroundings and make real-time decisions autonomously.
