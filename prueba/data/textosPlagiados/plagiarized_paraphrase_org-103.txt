diligence 4.0 concept and engineering guarantee the ongoing development of micro- and macro-economic entity aside focus on the principle of interconnectivity, digitalization, and automation. in this context, artificial intelligence cost meet angstrom one of the major enablers for ache logistics and bright production initiatives. This paper systematically analyze the scientific literature on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep teach in the context of smart logistics management indium industrial enterprises. Furthermore, establish on the consequence of the taxonomic literature review, the author introduce ampere conceptual framework, which supply fruitful implication free-base on recent research witness and insight to embody exploited for aim and starting future research enterprise indium the field of artificial intelligence (AI), machine determine (ML), and deep determine (DL) inch smart Logistics.
