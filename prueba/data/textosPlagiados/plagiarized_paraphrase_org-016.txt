astatine present, the application of artificial Intelligence (AI) in industrial control, smart base and other field has pick up good response. However, Army Intelligence engineering has certain requirements for computer performance, and besides faces problem in net security, data analysis, human-computer interaction, and so forth at present, the ocular platform of embedded system induce achieve remarkable result in practical applications, but information technology development has been seriously handicap aside problems such as Low overall development efficiency and unstable system performance. This paper design an EP Vision system (VS) based along artificial intelligence technology. The platform combine the embedded hardware design with the Support vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to realize the healthy robot interaction and target detection functions. The test results prove that when other weather exist the same, students and expert had 83.5% and 90% convinced evaluation of System X, and 16.5% and 10% negative evaluations respectively. However, their positive evaluation of System yttrium only account for 19% and 4%, while the negative evaluation account for 81% and 96%. The proportion of positive evaluation of system X was much eminent than that of system Y, which indicated that System X can meet the actual application requirements and better the system recognition efficiency to a certain extent. information technology picture the positive relationship between Army Intelligence engineering and EP VS.
