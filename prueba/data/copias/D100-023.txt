Recent technological developments have enabled computers to identify and categorize facial expressions to determine a person’s emotional state in an image or a video. This process, called “Facial Expression Recognition (FER)”, has become one of the most popular research areas in computer vision. In recent times, deep FER systems have primarily concentrated on addressing two significant challenges: the problem of overfitting due to limited training data availability, and the presence of expression-unrelated variations, including illumination, head pose, image resolution, and identity bias. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on deep FER, encompassing algorithms and datasets that offer insights into these intrinsic problems. Initially, it presents a detailed timeline showcasing the evolution of methods and datasets in deep facial expression recognition (FER). Then, a comprehensive review of FER methods is introduced, including the basic principles of FER and methods from the pro-deep learning era to the deep learning era. Moreover, a brief introduction is provided related to the benchmark datasets used to evaluate different FER methods and a comparison of different FER models. Existing deep neural networks and related training strategies designed for FER are discussed. The remaining challenges and corresponding opportunities in FER and the future directions for designing robust deep FER systems are also pinpointed.
