This paper begins by examining English text emotion expression and information communication, categorizing them according to the human emotion-value relationship, and summarizing their characteristics. Subsequently, it proposes constructing an analysis model for English text emotion and information communication using BiLSTM neural networks with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology. To address the unique features of English text efficiently, emotional information encoding is deemed necessary. Leveraging encoding, the BiLSTM neural network extracts emotional features of English text, mitigating the issue of emotional feature loss through the loss function. Furthermore, a crawler tool is employed to acquire datasets from the Chinese English module under the MOOC of Chinese universities. Evaluation indexes are established based on the modelâ€™s performance, followed by experimental analysis of English text emotion expression and information conveyance. Results demonstrate that compared with the original CNN, LSTM, and T-LSTM, the BiLSTM-based neural network performs better in text emotion expression and information conveyance tasks, maintaining an accuracy rate above 0.925. Moreover, its effectiveness on the English dataset surpasses that on the Chinese dataset slightly. This study aims to enhance English teaching and communication between Chinese and foreign cultures.
