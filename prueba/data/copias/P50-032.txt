Ensuring accurate trajectory tracking in real-world scenarios presents a significant challenge, particularly due to inherent tracking errors. This paper introduces a comprehensive motion planning and control framework designed to address these challenges by coordinating between the motion planning layer and the controller. The framework divides motion space into safe and risky regions, leveraging a repulsive potential field to accommodate tracking errors and ensure safety. By combining global search methods and a novel waypoint set filtering technique, collision-free waypoint sets are generated to facilitate trajectory planning. Additionally, an optimization-based approach minimizes trajectory acceleration, followed by an anti-collision modification to verify and refine the planned trajectory for safety. Through the incorporation of invertible transformation and adaptive compensation mechanisms, the framework effectively limits transient trajectory tracking errors within predefined regions, even in the presence of actuator faults. Overall, this motion planning and control framework ensures safety and reliability by coordinating planning and control levels to address tracking errors and actuator faults.
