As AI systems increasingly shape various aspects of society, concerns regarding AI bias and its impact on underprivileged groups become more prominent. Drawing from prior research demonstrating Virtual Reality's ability to enhance empathy, this laboratory study investigates participants' reactions to a biased AI scenario while embodying different personas. Participants embodied personas with varying abilities to achieve high financial credit scores due to age and gender, while interacting with a biased AI in Virtual Reality. Results indicate that participants felt significantly more empathy toward embodied personas and perceived the AI as less fair compared to a baseline condition. Qualitative analysis sheds light on participants' mental model creation concerning embodied personas.
