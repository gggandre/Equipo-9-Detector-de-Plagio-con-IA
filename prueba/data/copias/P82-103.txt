The principles of interconnectivity, digitalization, and automation inherent in Industry 4.0 concepts have paved the way for Smart Logistics and Smart Production initiatives, with artificial intelligence serving as a major enabler. This paper systematically analyzes the scientific literature on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in the context of Smart Logistics management in industrial enterprises. Based on the results of the literature review, a conceptual framework is presented, offering valuable implications for future research initiatives in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) in Smart Logistics.
