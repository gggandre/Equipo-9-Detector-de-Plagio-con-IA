In recent years, with the continuous progress and development of science and technology, especially the advancement of artificial intelligence, machine algorithms, and other technologies, the education system has begun to shift from traditional functions towards more personalized content. Traditional education systems often adopt a one-size-fits-all teaching approach, neglecting the unique needs and learning styles of individual students. An education system personalized and optimized by machine learning algorithms can offer tailored learning materials and recommendations based on each student's learning history, interests, and abilities, thereby enhancing learning outcomes. Machine learning algorithms can provide real-time feedback on student performance and adjust learning plans accordingly, making the learning process dynamic and personalized across various educational domains such as language learning, mathematics, and science. However, enhancing the efficiency of machine learning algorithms requires improvements in numerical optimization algorithms, necessitating a comprehensive overview of optimization algorithms in large-scale machine learning. This paper aims to provide a detailed overview of existing machine learning algorithms for optimizing personalized education recommendation systems and introduces the algorithm optimization process.
