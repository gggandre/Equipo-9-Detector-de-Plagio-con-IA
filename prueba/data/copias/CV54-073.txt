The quantification of usability expectation for an m-commerce mobile application through fuzzy logic-based methods involves measuring the usability of a mobile application by utilizing principles of fuzzy logic. The usability of any mobile application serves to gauge the user experience of the mobile application by analyzing user expectations and preferences. Fuzzy logic consistently emerges as the optimal choice for quantification. The quantification of usability expectation based on fuzzy logic evaluates the user experience of an m-commerce mobile application by considering the user's needs, preferences, and expectations. Usability expectation also takes into consideration the user's ability to comprehend and interact with the application, the extent to which the application fulfills the user's expectations, and overall satisfaction with the application. This process aids in identifying areas for improvement, enabling developers to make necessary adjustments for an enhanced user experience. This study introduces the design of a usability metric framework and subsequently quantifies the overall usability quality of an m-commerce mobile application with the assistance of fuzzy logic. The proposed usability metric framework is grounded in the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach and aims to offer a comprehensive and systematic approach to designing metrics for assessing the qualitative aspect of mobile applications. The framework has been developed and tested within an m-commerce context, providing a set of measurable criteria to quantify m-commerce mobile applications according to standards. The evaluation results can then be utilized to enhance m-commerce mobile applications and ensure optimized user experience.
