This study introduces the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision algorithms for detecting human emotions in video content during user interactions with diverse visual stimuli. The research aims to develop software capable of emotion detection by leveraging AI algorithms and image processing pipelines to identify users' facial expressions. The process involves evaluating users through images and implementing computer vision algorithms aligned with psychological theories defining emotions and their recognizable features. The study demonstrates the feasibility of emotion recognition through convolutional neural networks (CNN) and software development and training based on facial expressions. While successful in identifying emotions, further training is needed for contexts with more diverse images and additional algorithms to distinguish closely related emotional patterns. The discussion and conclusions underscore the potential of AI and computer vision algorithms in emotion detection, offering insights into software development, ongoing training, and the evolving landscape of emotion recognition technology.
