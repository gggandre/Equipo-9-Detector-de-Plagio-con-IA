Facial recognition technology (FRT) has become a dominant field in Computer Vision, particularly with the rise of deep learning and datasets. The advancements in deep facial recognition have been remarkable and are extensively utilized in real-world scenarios. A comprehensive facial recognition system comprises three key components: facial recognition, orientation, and representation. This system identifies faces, aligns them to a standardized view, and extracts features for recognition using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This paper delivers an exhaustive overview of the recent progressions in these domains, showcasing how deep learning has significantly bolstered their capabilities. Object detection in machine vision poses a formidable challenge necessitating substantial improvements. While image classification accuracy is on the brink of surpassing human performance at 2.25%, object detection algorithms still lag behind. Presently, algorithms achieve merely 40.8 MAPS on contemporary objects, emphasizing the criticality of meticulous dataset selection for optimal outcomes.
