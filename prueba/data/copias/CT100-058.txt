Network news serves as a vital source of social information for netizens, yet the sheer volume of news information often obscures key details. Named entity recognition technology offers a solution by classifying place, date, and other information in text. This article presents an innovative approach that combines named entity recognition and deep learning technology. Our proposed method introduces an automatic annotation approach for Chinese entity triggers and a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model capable of achieving high accuracy with a small training dataset. By jointly training sentence and trigger vectors through a trigger-matching network, our model effectively recognizes neologisms in web news and extends the web news word sentiment lexicon for sentiment observation. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional models, achieving an average accuracy rate of 97.88% in sentiment viewpoint detection.
