Empathy computing emerges as a burgeoning research domain amalgamating artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies to predict, identify, simulate, and generate human empathy. This nascent field leverages insights from psychological studies to inform its concepts, measurements, neural underpinnings, and applications, while pioneering innovative computing methodologies for empathy analysis and simulation. This article offers a critical appraisal of extant research on empathy computing, envisioning its future trajectory from a psychological perspective to facilitate foundational research and practical applications. Current research on empathy computing delineates four principal themes, encompassing diverse purposes and methodologies. From analyzing individual empathy traits to simulating empathetic dialogue, these themes offer rich insights into empathy's computational facets. Empathy computing's transformative potential extends across domains such as mental health, education, business services, and public management, fostering a more empathetic and responsive interaction paradigm between humans and technology. However, ethical considerations and safety concerns necessitate a cautious approach towards fully leveraging computers for empathetic tasks, advocating for a harmonious collaboration between humans and machines.
