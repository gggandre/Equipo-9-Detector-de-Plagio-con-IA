The burgeoning population inevitably results in an expanding consumer base, intensifying the burden and resources required to cater to the escalating consumer demands. Given technology's efficacy in addressing myriad challenges, leveraging it for streamlining the supermarket experience emerges as a viable proposition. The notion entails crafting a more convenient and advanced supermarket experience, obviating cashiers and queues to foster hassle-free shopping. This project integrates Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things to automate supermarkets for enhanced efficiency. Patrons merely need to scan their unique ID-laden QR code via a dedicated app upon entry, recording their presence. Smart shopping carts and baskets equipped with sensors detect product movements, while shelves, rigged with pressure sensors, discern product selection. These shelves solely unlock upon detecting a patron's shopping cart. At checkout, a mere card swipe deducts the purchase amount, furnishing patrons with a receipt. We aspire to extend this technology to numerous supermarket chains, domestically and internationally, facilitating implementation with a nominal one-time investment.
