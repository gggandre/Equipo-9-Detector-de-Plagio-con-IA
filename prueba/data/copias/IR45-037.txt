The future trajectory of autonomous vehicles rests at the nexus of human-centric design and advanced AI capabilities, transcending conventional transportation paradigms. Future autonomous vehicles will not merely transport passengers but also interact with and adapt to their preferences, culminating in comfortable, efficient, and delightful journeys. This paper introduces a pioneering framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to augment autonomous vehicles' decision-making processes. By amalgamating LLMs' natural language prowess and contextual comprehension with specialized tools, this framework endeavors to enhance various modules' operations within autonomous vehicles. This integration holds the promise of revolutionizing autonomous vehicles' operational ethos, proffering personalized assistance, continual learning, and transparent decision-making. Ultimately, this framework contributes to the advancement of safer and more efficient autonomous driving technologies.
