Commercial applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have witnessed significant progress in recent years, particularly in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and self-learning. However, the field of anesthesiology poses unique challenges due to its requirement for high reliability and rapid decision-making processes. This review explores the application of AI and ML in anesthesiology, elucidating how decision-making behaviors can emerge from simple equations and addressing relevant clinical questions.
