As the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in education continues to rise, there has been a notable increase in published studies in this field. However, no large-scale reviews have been undertaken to comprehensively explore the various aspects of AI applications in education. By analyzing 4,519 publications spanning from 2000 to 2019, we aim to address this gap and identify trends and topics related to AI applications in education (AIEd) using topic-based bibliometrics. Our review results reveal a growing interest in utilizing AI for educational purposes within the academic community. Key research topics include intelligent tutoring systems for special education, natural language processing for language education, educational robots for AI education, educational data mining for performance prediction, discourse analysis in computer-supported collaborative learning, neural networks for teaching evaluation, affective computing for learner emotion detection, and recommender systems for personalized learning. We also discuss the challenges and future directions of AIEd.
