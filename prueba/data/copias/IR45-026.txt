Facial recognition technology (FRT) emerges as a pivotal artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, aimed at curbing the virus spread. As preparations for future pandemics are underway, FRT is envisioned as a potent tool for tracking infected individuals and amassing real-time surveillance data. When appropriately employed, FRT can bolster governmental strategies to enact public health surveillance, delineated in literature as 'the systematic collection, storage, utilization, and dissemination of personal information to identify outbreaks and mitigate disease spread'. Nevertheless, FRT poses ethical and legal quandaries, including its utilization devoid of consent from surveilled individuals, safeguarding biometric data collected through surveillance, and the prospect of this data being repurposed for non-public health ends. Despite widespread deployment in nations like Russia and China, primarily for pandemic purposes and beyond, Western jurisdictions exhibit marked reluctance in its adoption.
