Fuzzy logic emerges as a potent tool for optimizing solutions in power flow, particularly within the framework of deregulated power systems. By employing fuzzy logic controls, the optimal placement of distribution generators (DGs) can be determined, ensuring that reliability indices are pinpointed through optimal power flow solutions and fuzzy logic controllers, thus maintaining system feasibility. In a deregulated power system, the strategic placement of distribution generator units plays a pivotal role in minimizing power loss and enhancing overall system performance by mitigating fluctuations. To identify areas of vulnerability, especially within transmission companies, gaining access to optimal power flow algorithms becomes indispensable in a deregulated power system. Both transmission and distribution networks need to be adjusted appropriately to alleviate congestion within their respective companies. The aggregator must evaluate system performance, utilizing data obtained from distribution and transmission companies within the deregulated power system.
