Autonomous vehicles (AVs) herald a paradigm shift in future transportation systems, with decision-making emerging as a critical module for high-level automated driving. In tackling intricate scenarios evading rule-based methods, data-driven decision-making approaches garner increased attention. The efficacy of such approaches is contingent upon the datasets utilized, warranting a comprehensive understanding of extant datasets. Driving data, categorized into vehicle-, environment-, and driver-related, delineate crucial aspects of AV decision-making. This study juxtaposes state-of-the-art datasets across these categories, outlining their attributes such as sensor usage, annotation, and driving scenarios. Leveraging dataset characteristics, we discuss potential applications across various facets of AV decision-making, facilitating researchers in selecting appropriate datasets to bolster their research endeavors. We also prognosticate future trends in AV dataset development, anticipating novel advancements.
